	"description": "This repository contains scripts for the simulation study to evaluate the performance of different classifiers and feature extraction strategies on active learning tasks applied to systematic reviewing. This repository contains the necessary scripts to run the simulation and obtain relevant information about each one (runtime, metrics and plots). The data used for the simulations was originally retrieved by Brouwer, Williams et al. ",
